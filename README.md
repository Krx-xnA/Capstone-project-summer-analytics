Capstone Project | Summer Analytics 2025

## ðŸ“Œ Background and Motivation

Urban parking spaces are limited and highly demanded. Static pricing often leads to overcrowding or underutilization. This project implements a real-time dynamic pricing engine that adapts based on occupancy, queue length, traffic, special days, vehicle type, and competitor pricing.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build 3 levels of pricing models:
- **Model 1:** Baseline linear model (based on occupancy)
- **Model 2:** Demand-based pricing using multiple features
- **Model 3 (optional):** Competitive pricing using location-based proximity

All models must:
- Start from a base price of $10
- Vary smoothly and explainably
- Be implemented from scratch using only Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Pathway

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3
- NumPy & Pandas
- Pathway (for real-time streaming)
- Bokeh (for live visualizations)

---

## ðŸ§¾ Data Description

Each timepoint (73 days, 18 times/day) contains:
- **Location:** Latitude & Longitude
- **Parking Lot Features:** Capacity, Occupancy, Queue length
- **Vehicle Info:** Vehicle type (car, bike, truck)
- **Environmental:** Traffic, Special day indicator
